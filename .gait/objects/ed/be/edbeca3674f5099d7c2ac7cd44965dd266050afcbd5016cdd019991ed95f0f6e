{"assistant":{"text":"Turn 14 Complete: Added automatic LSA retransmission loop to main agent per RFC 2328 Section 13.7.\n\n**Changes Made**:\n\n1. **wontyoubemyneighbor.py** - Added `_retransmission_loop()` async task:\n   - Runs every 5 seconds (matches flooding_mgr.retransmit_interval)\n   - Checks each Full neighbor's retransmission list\n   - Gets LSAs needing retransmission (timeout expired)\n   - Builds LSU packet with unacknowledged LSAs\n   - Sends retransmission LSU to neighbor\n   - Logs retransmission activity for debugging\n\n2. **wontyoubemyneighbor.py** - Added to async task gather:\n   - Retransmission loop runs continuously alongside other tasks\n   - Hello loop, receive loop, aging loop, SPF loop, monitor loop, retransmission loop\n\n**Retransmission Flow**:\n1. LSA sent to neighbor → added to retransmission list with timestamp\n2. Wait for LSAck from neighbor\n3. If LSAck received → remove from retransmission list (Turn 12)\n4. If no LSAck after 5 seconds → retransmit LSA\n5. Repeat until LSAck received or neighbor goes down\n\n**Impact**:\n- Ensures reliable LSA delivery in lossy networks\n- Automatic retry mechanism prevents LSDB inconsistencies\n- Critical for multi-router topologies with packet loss\n- Completes the flooding procedure implementation\n\n**RFC 2328 Compliance**:\n- Section 13.7: Retransmitting LSAs ✅\n- Section 13: The Flooding Procedure (fully complete) ✅\n\n**Next**: Turn 15 - Merge complete LSA flooding implementation to main branch","type":"message"},"context":{"artifacts":[{"wontyoubemyneighbor/wontyoubemyneighbor.py":"Added _retransmission_loop async task for automatic LSA retry"}],"pinned_context":{"branch":"lsa-flooding-complete","items":[],"memory_id":"b314f37aecef792868f1e2eaeffa36c6b2b11a1fc63314b312f16cd23fc21309","pinned_items":0,"schema":"gait.context.v0"}},"created_at":"2026-01-15T21:44:06","model":{"provider":"vscode-copilot"},"schema":"gait.turn.v0","tokens":{"by_role":{},"estimated":true,"input_total":12,"output_total":364},"tools":{},"user":{"text":"Turn 14: Add retransmission loop to main agent","type":"message"},"visibility":"private"}
